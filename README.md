### Abstract
Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in language-guided perceptual tasks such as recognition, segmentation, and object detection. However, their effectiveness in addressing visual cognition problems that require high-level multi-image reasoning and visual working memory is not well-established. One such challenge is **matrix reasoning** - the cognitive ability to discern relationships among patterns in a set of images and extrapolate to predict subsequent patterns. This skill is crucial during the early neurodevelopmental stages of children.

Inspired by the matrix reasoning tasks in Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), we propose a new dataset **MaRs-VQA** to evaluate the visual cognition capability of MLLMs and compare their performance with existing human visual cognition studies. Based on the training data of MaRs-VQA, we also finetune a baseline model **Qwen2-VCog** with multi-stage cognition reasoning annotations.

### Abstract
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in open-vocabulary perceptual tasks, yet their ability to solve complex cognitive problems remains limited, especially when visual details are abstract and require visual memory. Current approaches primarily scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the text space, even when language alone is insufficient for clear and structured reasoning, and largely neglect visual reasoning mechanisms analogous to the human visuo-spatial sketchpad and visual imagery.

To mitigate this deficiency, we introduce **Cognitive Supersensing**, a novel training paradigm that endows MLLMs with human-like visual imagery capabilities by integrating a **Latent Visual Imagery Prediction (LVIP)** head that jointly learns sequences of visual cognitive latent embeddings and aligns them with the answer, thereby forming vision-based internal reasoning chains. We further introduce a reinforcement learning stage that optimizes text reasoning paths based on this grounded visual latent.

To evaluate the cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, we present **CogSense-Bench**, a comprehensive visual question answering (VQA) benchmark assessing five cognitive dimensions: fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, visuospatial cognition, mental simulation, and visual routines.
